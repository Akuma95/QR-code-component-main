## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom variables
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

The CSS variables are more intuitive to use, as I have always used them sparingly and worked with hard-coded values.

### Useful resources

- [How To Use Google Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_google.asp) - I forgot how to implement Google Fonts in this page and find this helpful source.
